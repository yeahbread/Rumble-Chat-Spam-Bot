# [Rumble](https://rumble.com/) Chat Spam Bot

## Description üï∑
ü§ñ Spam every single active live stream all at once, with intervals for each stream.

This project is made as a proof of concept project, it's also only for educational purposes only, and I advise against using it for malicious activities!



## "Install"
To start this bot, simply:
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ ! Copy the current source code from [main.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeahbread/Rumble-Chat-Spam-Bot/main/main.js).
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ ! Visit [Rumble](https://rumble.com/), use an ALT account, to avoid getting banned, a VPN is also recommended, but not neccesary.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ ! Open your console by pressing F12, you may need to press FN + 12 to get F12.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ ! Near  top right, you should see a console tab, go to it, then paste the code
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ ! Press enter, then the bot menu should be running. From there it's simple, edit the settings so that it says whatever you want it to say.
